# PCB Independent Study MP1 - Spring 2024
## Using Eclectronics Course's MP1

For the first project of our PCB ISR, we wanted to create a simple circuit that would introduce us to the major tools of PCB design, from creating a schematic and layout in KiCad to fabricating the board. This project is based on miniproject 1 of Eclectronics.

### Design Requirements 
Theses requirements are taken almost verbatim from the miniproject 1 instructions: 
Your circuit must flash an LED with a period of 1 s.
Your circuit must run on a single-ended 3.3-V supply that is derived from the 5V VBUS supply in a standard type-A USB port.
Your circuit design may only use components from the (unmodified) spreadsheet provided with this assignment.
Your circuit must include adequate bypass and bulk capacitors for the integrated circuits, as specified in their datasheets.
Your PCB must be a two-layer design with all components on the top side of the board. The minimum allowable trace width and spacing is 6 mils. The minimum allowable via size is 24 mils with a 12-mil drill hole. A small part (i.e., less than 10%) of your grade for this project will be related to the area of your final PCB layout.
